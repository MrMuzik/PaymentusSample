This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The CSS was compiled with Sass.
(https://sass-lang.com/)

Animation was completed by importing and using React CSS Transition Group.
(http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition)

Icons were imported from React Icons.
(https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons)

Form toggle switches were imported from React Toggle.

All other code was hand-crafted. (Live Page: https://mrmuzik.github.io/PaymentusSample/)
